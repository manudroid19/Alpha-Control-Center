# A tribute to the project, in March 2020.

I was cleaning up my github, almost 5 years after the last commit in this project.ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º It was a very fun, extremely inspiring project made by two 16-17 years old teenagers who just wanted to have some fun programming and making their very first hardware device. Kinda like playing to make serious computer things ðŸ‘”. 

Without knowing too much, we were defining our future interests and our careers. Here I learned the basics and the essence of programming -not just throwing a few commands in an editor- and from a summer in high school, I got a tremendous advantage in lots of college lessonsðŸ¤“. 

I will always remember this project with a smile, with [@Charlio99](https://github.com/Charlio99) :heart: we learned how fun it could be to make a team project:relaxed:! I retrieved here from the Telegram time machine some of the screenshots we shared in the development, and I made some screenshots myself so this project is kept in our memories as it deserves. Manuel from 2025, fix this embarrassing readme and remove the emojis, they should be old fashioned :space_invader::space_invader::clown_face:.
